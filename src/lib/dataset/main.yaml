  - title: "Ecologies of LLM Practices: an inquiry on daily professional usage of LLMs"
    description: "This research project investigates the evolving landscape of Large Language Model (LLM) usage within professional environments, examining how these AI tools are being integrated into daily workflows across various industries and disciplines. The inquiry focuses on understanding the complex ecosystem that emerges when professionals adopt LLMs as part of their regular practice, exploring both the transformative potential and the challenges that arise from this technological integration. The study employs ethnographic methods to document how different professional communities adapt to and shape LLM technologies, revealing the diverse strategies, workarounds, and innovations that emerge in real-world applications. By mapping the actual practices rather than intended uses, the research uncovers the gap between technological promises and lived experiences, highlighting how professionals negotiate issues of reliability, creativity, efficiency, and professional identity when working with AI systems. Key areas of investigation include the development of new professional literacies around prompt engineering and AI collaboration, the emergence of hybrid human-AI workflows, and the institutional changes required to accommodate these new tools. The project also examines the social and ethical dimensions of LLM adoption, including questions of authorship, accountability, and the changing nature of expertise in an AI-augmented workplace. Through detailed case studies across sectors such as education, journalism, legal services, and creative industries, the research builds a comprehensive understanding of how LLM practices are reshaping professional knowledge work. The findings contribute to broader discussions about the future of work, the role of AI in society, and the need for new frameworks to understand human-AI collaboration in professional contexts."
