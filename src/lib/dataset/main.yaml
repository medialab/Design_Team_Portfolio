  - title: 'Ecologies of LLM Practices: an inquiry on daily professional usage of LLMs'
    description: 'How can we reframe the role of LLMs in ordinary work practices? The booming rise of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has sparked a rush to produce discourse about these technologies. The quick crystallization of a shared outlook around a few key themes has narrowed the scope of potential interrogations. Public and scientific debates focus on technical issues: algorithmic bias, confabulation, and intellectual property violations. However, the problems and consequences associated with their actual use – for both their users and their professional contexts – remain largely unexplored. This asymmetry fuels a mechanical view of technological development and its effects, as if the technical analysis of these systems were enough to predict their social impact. Moreover, these discourses present AI as a monolithic and disruptive entity, dismissing the possibility that it may be aligned with existing practices and that its effects may vary depending on situations encountered in ones job.'

  - title: 'FUTURE-OBS'
    description: 'How can digital traces help to identify and represent human interactions with fragile coastal socio-ecosystems? The livelihoods of more than 3 billion people depend on coastal marine ecosystems. The "FUTURE-OBS: Augmented Observatory for coastal socio-ecosystems" project is a pioneering initiative to advance the understanding of coastal socio-ecosystems in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures. The project combines traditional ocean observing methods with cutting-edge techniques such as environmental genomics and in situ biodiversity imaging. By using social media data to monitor human interactions with these vulnerable spaces - the work package led by the médialab - the project pushes the boundaries of what is possible to observe and understand these complex systems.'

    description: 'What do you do when you are disoriented, when the compass of your phone goes haywire? You reset it. The procedure depends on the situation and device, but you always have to stay calm and carefully follow instructions if you want the compass to capture signals again. Modernity was a way to differentiate past and future, North and South, progress and regress, radical and conservative. However, at a time of deep ecological mutation, such a compass is running in wild circles without offering much bearing anymore. This is why it is time for a reset.'

The platform allows users to navigate over 20 years of UN climate negotiations as captured by IISD's reporting system: the Earth Negotiations Bulletin. It provides a series of visual diagrams presenting the main actors (countries and negotiating groupings), the stakes of negotiations (mitigation, adaptation, Kyoto Protocol, post-Kyoto…) as well as the evolution of their respective and combined visibility over time, and a search engine allowing users to filter and browse the verbatims of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin."

The project develops methodologies to monitor and document the effects of algorithmic personalization and the temporal changes introduced by platforms to their recommendation engines. This allows to study how results to frequent climate queries are changing over time, and the extent to which personalization contributes to enclose people in "information bubbles". The project also designs experimental protocols to investigate how changes in access to climate information on platforms might influence public understanding of climate change and attitude towards climate policies.'

The circuits of information have been profoundly transformed by the emergence of the digital public space which now occupies a central place in the formation of public opinion. The objective of this project is to conduct a structural analysis of these transformations in order to put into context questions relating to disinformation, political polarisation and the production of public problems. Based on a systematic collection begun in 2018 of articles published by nearly 460 French media (newspaper websites, radio, TV, blogs, etc.), this project relies on a data collection infrastructure allowing to track the circulation of information on the web, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Its objective is to develop a structural approach to the digital public space that is mapped using methods of automatic categorisation and embedding of textual, relational or even visual data from content.'

In particular, it provides support to collect, enhance, clean up, visualize and analyze data from digital traces accessible online. The instrument stands at the intersection of the fields of methodological research and digital methods in social sciences. As well as supporting researchers in their methodology, the team offers them its skills in network analysis and web archiving, as well as in controversy analysis following Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory (ANT). The instrument created several dedicated digital social science tools released as open source, such as the web crawler Hyphe and the Twitter collection software Gazouilloire."

  - title: 'European Polarisation Observatory (EPO) avec CIVICA Research'
    description: "How to measure polarisation in multipolar and multi-issue European socio-political systems? Traditionally, people's opinions on different issues of the public debate have been studied through polls and surveys. But recent advancements in network scaling methods have shown that digital behavioral traces (typically following/follower networks) in social media platforms can be used to mine opinions at a massive scale. This project seeks to develop a proof of concept for a European Polarisation Observatory of ideologies and attitudes towards issues of the public debate. It will study the ideological dynamics of users and media outlets to measure polarization on various issues, and investigate the role of algorithmic recommendations on user access to ideologically diverse news."

AIPM as a project is a point of articulation between algorithmic and social dynamics, and thus proposes a computer science and sociological angle to the question of the political impact of algorithms on social media. The project builds on ideological social network embedding methods and political surveys research to propose a double network and opinion space modeling of digital public spaces. Using this double network and spatial opinion analysis, the project proposes to test whether algorithms learn and leverage political opinions of users through algorithmic explainability, how they affect information dynamics in public debate, and to open a path towards actionable tools capable of guiding algorithm design, governance, and policy.'

The Studio adapts research methodology to pedagogical objectives of higher education and continuous training, in particular when students are invited to apply the knowledge produced by social sciences and humanities in order to effectuate social change, to innovate or to generate transformative projects. Rather than searching for quick fixes, we aim at the slow composition of problems. Composing better problems requires tools to navigate the different types of expertise, stemming from disciplinary background, epistemic authority, economic interests, social positions, or lived experience, that see issues differently.'

    description: "How do we compose a common world? Not so long ago, the project that wished to see modernization spread all over the world came across unexpected opposition from the world itself. Should we give up, deny the problem, or grit our teeth and hope for a miracle? Alternatively we could inquire into what this modern project means so as to find how it can start again on a new footing. Such an inquiry becomes possible if we accept that there is a huge gap between the Moderns' experience and the accounts they give of it. The aim, both ambitious and modest, will be to propose an alternative for the term 'modernize', one which is compatible with the expression 'ecologize' and which we sum up with the term 'composition'. Learning how to compose the common world is what is at stake."
