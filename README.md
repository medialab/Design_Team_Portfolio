# Portfolio of the design team inside Sciences Po's medialab

The reason taht brought us to create this portfolio was not to emancipate our activities from all the others of the lab but instead of creating a visual space where the various projects born in the context of the design team, can be displayed and viewed from the outside/inside community.


## How to contribute to this portfolio

If you are a member of the design team, follow this:

- Request access to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zMeGVo7JuKLGw5iV_XewChInCEb070VP?usp=drive_link
- Create a new folder with the TAG you want to give to your project (A tag must be of 5 characters and unique)
- Fill the folder with all the medias that will be displayed in the website. Accepted medias are: .png, .jpg, .webp, .avif, .mp4, .mov. (other mediatypes will not be featured as of now)
- Open the .yaml file in the Github editor (https://github.com/medialab/Design_Team_Portfolio/blob/d52984ef6a3d9489c3676905fd68f7b3aa9a319a/src/lib/dataset/main.yaml)
- Add a project with the same specs as the other, in the .yaml
- Assign the same TAG you've defined before as the "tag" variable.
- Once you've finished writing the project, commit the PR and wait for acceptance
- You're done
