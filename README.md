# Portfolio of the design team inside Sciences Po's medialab

The reason taht brought us to create this portfolio was not to emancipate our activities from all the others of the lab but instead of creating a visual space where the various projects born in the context of the design team, can be displayed and viewed from the outside/inside community.
